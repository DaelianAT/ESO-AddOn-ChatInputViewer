This AddOn was created especially for role-players.

When role-playing in ESO you have the problem that you cannot see the complete text you have entered in the chat input field.

This AddOn displays the complete text in a separate field, placed directly below the chat window.

When the input reaches 80% of the maximum possible number of characters, the text colour changes to yellow, at 90 to orange and at 100% to red.

In the Settings the font size, window width and the number of lines displayed can be set.
