This AddOn was written especially for role-players.

When role-playing in ESO you often encounter the problem that you cannot see the complete text you have entered in the chat input field.

This AddOn displays the complete text in a separate field, placed directly below the chat window.

When the input reaches 80% of the maximum possible number of characters, the text colour changes to yellow, at 90 to orange and at 100% to red.

In the Settings the font size, window width and the number of displayed lines can be set.


== Dependencies ==

LibAddonMenu-2.0 (Version >= 40)


== Supported Languages ==

En, FR, EN, RU


== When using for the first time ==

The area for displaying the chat input is displayed below the chat window. If the chat window extends to the bottom edge of the screen, as is normally the case, the display area is not visible. The bottom edge of the chat window must then be moved upwards.

V. 1.1.0 - Russian translation added.
         - Bugfix for character counting of multibyte characters.
         - Spelling errors removed
